# Data-scraping
Zomato website Data scraping

This is a python script to perform data scraping from one of the top rated food websites, Zomato.
I've written a python script to extract restaurant name, restaurant address and restaurant phone numbers.
This process is continued until the last page is reached on the website or is explicitly stopped beforhand according to the requirement.
Once all the pages have been scraped, it is written into an excel file in human readable style.

Go nuts, with your data.

## How to use

Clone this repository:

```commandline
git clone git@github.com:dakshsard/Data-scraping.git
```

Run `Zomato_scraping.py` script (it will be inside the `Data-scraping` directory):

```commandline
python Zomato_scraping.py
```
